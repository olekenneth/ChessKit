14...Rxg8 15.f4 { This move does not solve the problem of the rook on a1, or
the strong knight on d4. It opens the diagonal for the queen but white had higher
priorities than this. } ( 15.c3 { The knight on d4 is a strong piece and
white needs to chase it away. First, limit the opponent's pieces and only then
start with your own plans. } 15...Ne6 ( 15...Nc6 16.Qd2 h5 17.Rg1 { Exchanging pieces
will bring white even closer to the goal. } ) 16.Bxe6 Kxe6 17.d4 Bb6 18.Qd2 { Next, Rg1 with a rook exchange will decide the game. } ) 15...Ne6 { Black is
trying to put the knight on f4 but obviously white will exchange it. Thus, it
was better to keep the knight in the center. } ( 15...a6 { With the idea of b5.
Black does not have a plan but waiting for white to finish this game. } ) 16.Bxe6 { Exchanging pieces especially the knights benefits white who is up in
material. } 16...Kxe6 17.Qh5 { The queen is out and will collect pawns, while Rg1 is
next, trading rooks and winning. } ( 17.Qf3 { Requires less calculations.
Defending the f2-pawn and preparing Rg1. } ) 17...Bxf2 18.Qxh6+ ( 18.fxe5 { Opening the f-file and because the rook cannot get to g1, white plans to put
it on f1. } ) 18...f6 19.f5+ ( 19.fxe5 { I would open the f-file for the
rook. } ) 19...Kf7 20.Rf1 Bd4 21.c3 Bc5 22.Rf3 { The rook is needed on the
1st-rank defending the g1-square. The queen shall go around and take all the
pawns on the kingside. } ( 22.Qxh7+ Rg7 23.Qh5+ Ke7 24.Qh8 { the queen goes to
b8 attacking pawns on the queenside. Then white can start pushing the
queenside pawns. } ) ( 22.h4 { makes room for the king, thus freeing the rook. } ) 22...Rg1#
